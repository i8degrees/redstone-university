## Appendix B: Glossary

This glossary compiles key terms from the Redstone University curriculum, organized alphabetically. Each term’s definition is followed by a footnote indicating the module where it is introduced.

**Binary**
: A base-2 number system that uses only two symbols, 0 and 1, to represent information. It is the fundamental language of all digital computers. [1]

**Bit**
: A single "binary digit," which can be either a 0 or a 1. It is the smallest possible unit of data in computing. [1]

**Bitwise Operation**
: An operation in software that manipulates numbers at the level of their individual bits, rather than their decimal value. [1]

**Boolean Algebra**
: A branch of mathematics for working with true/false values (1/0), using operators like AND, OR, and NOT. [2]

**Bus (Input Bus)**
: A collection of parallel wires that carry a complete piece of binary information. Our 4-bit input interface creates a 4-bit bus. [1]

**Composite Gate**
: A logic gate constructed by combining primitive gates (e.g., an AND gate built from NOT and OR gates). [2]

**Decimal**
: The base-10 number system that humans commonly use, with ten unique symbols (0-9). [1]

**Diode**
: A component that allows a signal to flow in only one direction, preventing back-powering. The Redstone Repeater is our primary diode. [0]

**Functionally Complete**
: A set of gates from which any Boolean function can be built (e.g., just NAND or just NOR). [2]

**Input**
: A component, like a Lever, that allows a user to manually control a circuit. [0]

**Interface (Input Interface)**
: A device that allows a user or system to provide information to a machine. Our 4-lever setup is a manual input interface. [1]

**Inverter (NOT Gate)**
: A circuit or component that flips a signal from ON to OFF, or OFF to ON. The Redstone Torch is our primitive inverter. [0]

**Logic Gate**
: A physical or virtual device that implements a Boolean operation. [2]

**Output**
: A component, like a Redstone Lamp, that displays the result or state of a circuit. [0]

**Power Source**
: A component, like a Redstone Torch or Lever, that outputs a full-strength (15) signal. [0]

**Primitive Gate**
: A basic, indivisible logic gate from which more complex gates are built. In our course, these are NOT and OR. [2]

**Register**
: A small, extremely fast storage location inside a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that holds data for immediate use. [1]

**Repeater**
: A component that acts as a signal booster (refreshing signal strength to 15) and a diode. [0]

**Signal Strength**
: The power level of a Redstone signal, ranging from 15 (full) down to 0 (off). A signal loses 1 strength for every block of dust it travels. [0]

**Strong Power**
: A type of power provided by components like Repeaters or Torches directly to a block. It can activate all adjacent Redstone components, including dust. [0]

**Truth Table**
: A chart showing all possible input/output combinations for a logic gate or circuit. [2]

**Weak Power**
: A type of power provided by Redstone Dust to a block. It can activate components like lamps and repeaters, but not adjacent Redstone dust. [0]

**Wire**
: Our term for any component, usually Redstone Dust, that transmits a signal from one point to another. [0]

**XOR (Exclusive OR)**
: Outputs 1 if inputs are different; used in both hardware and software for unique logic tricks. [2]
