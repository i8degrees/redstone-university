# Part III: The Processor Core

Excellent work completing Part II. Take a moment to appreciate what you have accomplished. You have engineered a powerful arithmetic unit that can add and subtract, and you've built a robust display system that can handle any result it produces. You have mastered the art of computer mathematics.

But a processor is more than just a math machine; it's also a *logic* machine. We've built AND, OR, and XOR gates, but they're not yet part of our main processor. The theme for Part III is to finally assemble all of our computational components into the single, unified, controllable brain of our computer: the **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**.

### Our Mission for Part III

This part is focused on the grand assembly of our processor's core. We will build the final control systems and then forge everything into our most complex component yet.

*   **In Module 8 (The Multiplexer),** before we can build the ALU, we must first build its "steering wheel." We'll learn about and construct a Multiplexer, a crucial digital switch that allows us to choose between multiple different inputs.
*   **In Module 9 (The ALU),** this is the capstone project for our processor. We will bring all our previous work—the adder/subtractor, the logic gates—into one place and use our new Multiplexer to build a complete, multi-function ALU that can be commanded to perform a wide variety of operations.

By the end of this Part, the brain of our computer will be complete. We will have built the single most important component in any CPU, setting the stage for the final act: bringing it to life.

Let's get started with Module 8 and build our digital switch.
