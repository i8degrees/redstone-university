# Part V: Post-Graduate Studies - Advanced Engineering

Congratulations, graduate of Redstone University! You have successfully completed the core curriculum. You have designed and built a fully operational, programmable 4-bit computer from scratch. You understand its number system, its logic, its processor, its memory, and the clock that brings it all to life. This is a monumental achievement.

The main course is over, but for those who are hungry for a greater challenge, the university offers a post-graduate program.

In Part V, we will tackle an advanced engineering problem that we sidestepped earlier for the sake of efficiency. This bonus content is designed to stretch your skills and show you the kind of complexity required to make computers perfectly align with human expectations.

### Our Mission for Part V

This special section contains a single, challenging module that will test everything you've learned.

*   **In Module 12 (The "Real World" Display),** we will finally solve the problem we encountered back in Module 4: how to display a number like "13" using two separate decimal digits. We chose the elegant programmer's solution of Hexadecimal, but now we will build the complex engineer's solution used in real-world calculators and digital clocks: the Double Dabble algorithm.

This final module is not for the faint of heart. It is a true capstone project that will result in the most "human-friendly" version of our computer. It's the perfect challenge for those who looked at their completed computer and asked, "What's next?"

Welcome to advanced studies. Let's dive into Module 12.
