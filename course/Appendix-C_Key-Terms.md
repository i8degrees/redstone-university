### Appendix C: Key Terms

---

#### Key Terms (Module 2)

-   **Boolean Algebra:** A branch of mathematics for working with true/false values (1/0), using operators like AND, OR, and NOT.
-   **Logic Gate:** A physical or virtual device that implements a Boolean operation.
-   **Primitive Gate:** A basic, indivisible logic gate from which more complex gates are built. In our course, these are NOT and OR.
-   **Composite Gate:** A logic gate constructed by combining primitive gates (e.g., an AND gate built from NOT and OR gates).
-   **Truth Table:** A chart showing all possible input/output combinations for a logic gate or circuit.
-   **Diode**: A component that allows an electrical signal to pass in only one direction. In Minecraft, the Redstone Repeater acts as a perfect diode.
-   **Functionally Complete:** A set of gates from which any Boolean function can be built (e.g., just NAND or just NOR).
-   **Bitwise Operation:** A software operation that manipulates individual bits of a number.
-   **XOR (Exclusive OR):** Outputs 1 if inputs are different; used in both hardware and software for unique logic tricks.

#### Key Terms (Module 3)

-   **Decoder:** A circuit that takes a multi-bit binary input and activates a single, corresponding output line.
-   **Encoder:** A circuit that takes a single active input line and translates it into a multi-bit coded output (like the patterns for a 7-segment display).
-   **Active-Low Logic:** A design principle where the "active" or "on" state is represented by a LOW (unpowered) signal, rather than a HIGH (powered) one.
-   **Tap (Repeater/Torch):** Our term for a connection that reads a signal from a bus line to control another wire.
-   **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** A type of storage where data is permanently programmed into the hardware's structure.
-   **Diode Matrix:** A grid of input and output lines where diodes (in our case, Redstone Repeaters and torches) are placed at intersections to create a programmable logic device, often used as a ROM.
-   **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal):** A method of representing the decimal digits 0-9 using a 4-bit binary code.
-   **7-Segment Display:** An arrangement of seven light segments that can be combined to display numbers and some letters.
