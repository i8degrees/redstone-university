# Welcome to Redstone University!

Have you ever used a computer or a smartphone and wondered what’s *really* happening inside? Not just the software, but the deep, physical magic of a machine that seems to "think"?

This isn't just another Minecraft course. This is a journey into the heart of the machine.

As a non-traditional, self-taught software engineer, I found myself wanting to explore the foundational principles of computer science. I realized that the abstract concepts of binary, logic gates, and computer architecture were difficult to grasp from books and theory alone. At the same time, I saw the incredibly complex and logical machines being built in Minecraft with Redstone. The idea was born: **what if we could learn how a computer works by building one from scratch, using tools we already love?**

That is the mission of Redstone University. We will make the abstract tangible. We will turn theory into a physical, working machine that you can walk around inside of.

## My Personal Journey & Course Philosophy

Redstone University is the product of my own adventure learning digital logic and computer architecture. This adventure started with curiosity and grew into a passion for building, experimenting, and teaching. Every lesson, every build, and every design choice in this course is shaped by what felt intuitive and exciting to me as a learner. I’ve structured the curriculum to follow the path that made the most sense to me: building what I wanted to see next, solving the problems that naturally arose, and always striving to make each concept click in a hands-on, visual way.

**What sets this course apart?**
- It’s grounded in *real experience*: you’ll follow the same journey I did, learning not just the “what” but the “why” and “how” behind each step.
- We use **Minecraft** as our laboratory, making abstract concepts tangible and fun.
- We focus on clarity and intuition, not just efficiency or speed.

## Course Build Philosophy

> **Disclaimer:** The builds and circuits in this course are intentionally designed for clarity and educational value, not for performance or compactness. We lay out circuits horizontally and in a “paper-like” fashion to make the logic easy to follow, just as you would draw them on paper. Our goal is to illustrate the underlying principles of computer engineering, not to create the most efficient or smallest circuits.

## How the Course is Structured

This course is organized as a complete curriculum, taking you from zero knowledge to a fully functional, programmable 4-bit computer. It is divided into Parts (major phases), Modules (specific projects), and Lessons (step-by-step instructions).

You’ll find:
-   **Personal motivation and narrative:** Each module is introduced with a story or challenge that mirrors my own learning process.
-   **Hands-on builds:** Every concept is brought to life with a Minecraft circuit and, where helpful, a CircuitVerse diagram.
-   **Theory and practice:** The modules balance foundational theory with immediate, practical application.
-   **Real-world and software connections:** You’ll see how each idea relates to real computers and even to programming challenges.

## The Journey Ahead

-   **Part I: The Foundations - Speaking to the Machine.** We will begin by learning the absolute basics of Redstone and binary. We will then master the grammar of Boolean logic and use it to construct our own "keyboard" and "monitor."
    -   **Module 0 (Optional):** The Redstone Toolkit
    -   **Module 1:** The 4-Bit Input Interface
    -   **Module 2:** The Language of Logic
    -   **Interlude (Optional):** The Art of Compact Design
    -   **Module 3:** Decoders & Digital Displays

-   **Part II: Engineering a Robust Arithmetic Unit.** Here, we will build the mathematical core of our machine. We'll engineer an adder and subtractor, discover our machine's natural limitations through "bugs" like overflow, and upgrade our system to solve them, just like real engineers.

-   **Part III: The Processor Core.** With our arithmetic unit perfected, we will forge the true brain of our computer: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). We will combine all our mathematical and logical circuits into one powerful, versatile, and controllable component.

-   **Part IV: Creating an Automated Computer.** In the final core modules, we'll give our processor a memory to store its thoughts and a clock to act as its heartbeat. We will assemble everything into a single, automated machine that can run a simple program on its own.

-   **Part V: Post-Graduate Studies.** For those who want to go even further, we'll explore advanced topics, tackling the complex challenge of making our computer display multi-digit decimal numbers, just like a real-world calculator.

## Who Is This For?

This course is for the curious. It's for:
*   **My daughter, Ada**, for whom this project was first imagined.
*   **Students and kids** who want a fun, hands-on introduction to STEM and computer science.
*   **University CS students** who want a physical way to visualize the concepts from their "Computer Architecture" class.
*   **Self-taught programmers and professionals** who want to solidify their understanding of what's happening at the hardware level.

## How to Get Started & Accessibility

This course is designed to be followed along in **Minecraft**. However, Minecraft is not strictly required!

For each module, I will provide guidance, and I also provide a **World Download** (the "RU Campus") with the completed circuits. You can use this to check your work, explore the final product, or use the pre-built components as "black boxes" if you want to focus more on the high-level concepts.

**The "No-Minecraft Track":** If you don't have Minecraft or prefer a more theoretical approach, you can still complete this entire course. Every lesson will include text descriptions, diagrams, and schematics. I will also provide links to free online digital logic simulators (like [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/simulator)) where you can build and test these circuits without the game. The core learning is in the logic, not just the blocks.

I am excited for you to join me on this journey. It's time to stop just *using* computers and start *understanding* them.

## How to Use This Course

- **Follow the modules in order:** Each module builds on the last, so start at the beginning and work your way through.
- **Try the builds yourself:** The hands-on experience is where the real learning happens. Use Minecraft or CircuitVerse as you prefer.
- **Use the world download or diagrams:** If you get stuck or want to check your work, explore the provided world or reference the diagrams.
- **Read the real-world and software connections:** These sections help you see why each concept matters beyond Minecraft.
- **Go at your own pace:** Take your time with each lesson, and revisit earlier modules whenever you need a refresher.
