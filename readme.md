## About The Project

Have you ever used a computer and wondered what’s *really* happening inside? Not just the software, but the deep, physical magic behind it all?

**Redstone University** provides a complete curriculum for learning computer architecture from first principles. Instead of abstract theory, our campus is the world of Minecraft, where we make concepts tangible by building a working computer you can walk around inside of.

This project was born from a personal journey to understand these foundations and a desire to share that passion with my daughter, Ada. Ada introduced me to minecraft when she was not even 2 years old. Hopefully when the time comes for her to learn these concepts, this course will guide her.

The mission is to create a hands-on, intuitive learning path for anyone curious about what's happening deep inside the machine. The idea was born: **what if we could learn these concepts in a tangible way, by building a computer from scratch, using tools we already love?**

### Who Is This For?

This course is for the curious. It's for:
*   **My daughter, Ada**, for whom this project was first imagined.
*   **Students and kids** who want a fun, hands-on introduction to STEM and computer science.
*   **University CS students** who want a physical way to visualize the concepts from their "Computer Architecture" class.
*   **Self-taught programmers and professionals** who want to solidify their understanding of what's happening at the hardware level.

## Course Structure & Curriculum

This course is structured as a complete curriculum, taking you from zero knowledge to a fully functional, programmable 4-bit computer. We will follow a clear, logical path, broken into five distinct parts:

*   **Part I: The Foundations - Speaking to the Machine.** We will start from the absolute basics, learn the binary language of computers, master the grammar of Boolean logic by building fundamental gates, and finally construct our own "keyboard" and "monitor" to form a complete input/output system.
*   **Part II: Engineering a Robust Arithmetic Unit.** Here, we will build the mathematical core of our machine. We'll engineer an adder and subtractor, discover our machine's natural limitations through "bugs" like overflow, and upgrade our system to solve them, just like real engineers.
*   **Part III: The Processor Core.** With our arithmetic unit perfected, we will forge the true brain of our computer: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). We will combine all our mathematical and logical circuits into one powerful, versatile, and controllable component.
*   **Part IV: Creating an Automated Computer.** In the final core modules, we'll give our processor a memory to store its thoughts and a clock to act as its heartbeat. We will assemble everything into a single, automated machine that can run a simple program on its own.
*   **Part V: Post-Graduate Studies.** For those who want to go even further, we'll explore advanced topics, tackling the complex challenge of making our computer display multi-digit decimal numbers, just like a real-world calculator.
