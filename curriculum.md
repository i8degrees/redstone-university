# Redstone University: The Curriculum

**Project Vision:** To demystify computer science by guiding learners to build a tangible, 4-bit computer in Minecraft. The course prioritizes understanding foundational theory (Boolean algebra, digital logic) before applying it in satisfying, practical builds, with a strong emphasis on modular, expandable design.

## Part II: The Thinking Machine – Building the Processor (5 Modules)
*(The goal of this Part is to construct the entire mathematical and logical brain of our computer, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), capable of not only calculation but also decision-making.)*

### Module 5: The 4-Bit Adder & The Hexadecimal Upgrade
-   **Narrative Beat:** Time for math! We'll build an adder, discover its limitations with our display, and upgrade our system to a new language—Hexadecimal—to fix it.
-   **Learning Goals:** Build a ripple-carry adder, discover "out of range" bugs, learn hexadecimal, and appreciate modular design by upgrading the decoder and encoder.
-   **Minecraft Artifacts:** A 4-bit adder connected to an upgraded 4-to-16 decoder and hex-capable display.
-   **The Payoff:** The calculation `$8+4$` initially fails, but after the upgrade, it correctly displays a `$C$`.

### Module 6: Advanced Arithmetic – Overflow and Subtraction
-   **Narrative Beat:** We'll push our adder to its breaking point, learn to detect "overflow," and then, with a mathematical trick, teach it how to subtract.
-   **Learning Goals:** Understand arithmetic overflow, the carry bit, and Two's Complement for negative numbers.
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A unified adder/subtractor unit with an overflow indicator light.

### Module 7: Comparators and Status Flags
-   **Narrative Beat:** Our machine can calculate, but it can't make decisions. It needs to ask questions: "Is this result zero?" We'll build circuits to compare numbers and "flags" to store the answers.
-   **Learning Goals:** Build a magnitude comparator ($A=B$) and understand the concept of a status register (Zero Flag, Negative Flag).
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A 4-bit comparator and a 2-bit flag register.

### Module 8: The Multiplexer – The Digital Switch
-   **Narrative Beat:** Before we assemble the brain, we need to build its "steering wheel"—the Multiplexer, a circuit that lets us choose between different data paths.
-   **Learning Goals:** Understand the theory and application of a Multiplexer (MUX).
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A functional 4-bit 2-to-1 MUX.

### Module 9: The ALU – The Grand Assembly
-   **Narrative Beat:** The grand assembly. We will forge all our arithmetic, comparison, and logic circuits into the final brain of our computer: the Arithmetic Logic Unit.
-   **Learning Goals:** Combine multiple functions into a single, controllable unit that sets status flags based on its results.
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A complete ALU that can add, subtract, and perform logical operations, outputting both a result and status flags.

## Part III: The Automated Computer – Memory and Control (3 Modules)
*(The goal of this Part is to achieve true automation. We will add memory and a control unit, transforming our powerful calculator into a genuine computer that can execute a program containing logic and loops.)*

### Module 10: The Processor's Scratchpad – Building a Register
-   **Narrative Beat:** Our ALU is a powerful but forgetful brain. We need to give it a "sticky note" to hold one number temporarily.
-   **Learning Goals:** Understand how data is stored electronically using Gated D-Latches and construct a 4-bit Memory Register.
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A functional 4-bit register that can store a single number.

### Module 11: Addressable Storage – Building RAM
-   **Narrative Beat:** A single scratchpad isn't enough for a real program. We will now scale up our register into a "notebook" with 16 numbered pages, building true Random Access Memory (RAM).
-   **Learning Goals:** Understand memory addressing, use a decoder to select a specific register, and assemble a complete 16x4-bit RAM module.
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A functional, addressable 16x4-bit RAM module.

### Module 12: The Control Unit & Programmable Logic
-   **Narrative Beat:** The moment of truth. We will build the computer's conductor—the Control Unit—and connect everything. We will then give it the power to read our status flags and **jump to different parts of a program**, enabling true `` `if/else` `` logic and loops.
-   **Learning Goals:** Understand the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Build a clock, program counter, and control unit. Create a simple instruction set with a **conditional jump** instruction.
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** The final, complete, working 4-bit computer that can run a program with loops from RAM.
-   **The Ultimate Payoff:** Writing and watching a program that performs a countdown loop, demonstrating that the computer is making decisions based on the status flags built in Part II.

## Part IV: Post-Graduate Studies (Bonus Content)
*(For students who have completed the core curriculum and wish to explore advanced engineering challenges.)*

### Module 13: The "Real World" Display – The Double Dabble Algorithm

-   **Learning Goals:** Build a proper Binary-to-BCD conversion circuit for multi-digit decimal display.
-   **Minecraft Artifact:** A Double Dabble circuit that converts a single binary input into two separate decimal digits.

### Potential Future Modules
-   **The Shifter:** Adding a barrel shifter to the ALU to perform bitwise shift operations (`` `<<` ``, `` `>>` ``), essential for efficient multiplication and division.
-   **Basic I/O:** Interfacing with the world beyond a display, such as using Note Blocks for sound output based on the computer's state.
-   **Subroutines:** Implementing a stack pointer and `` `CALL` ``/`` `RETURN` `` instructions to allow for reusable functions in your programs.
