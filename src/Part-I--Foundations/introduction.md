## Part I: The Foundations - Laying the Groundwork

---

Welcome to Part I of our journey to build a working computer from scratch! Every masterpiece starts with a strong foundation. In this part, we’re going to master the fundamental tools, concepts, and components that will allow us (as humans) to communicate with our digital creation.

---

By the end of Part I, our computer won’t be thinking on its own yet, but we will have a complete input and output system. You’ll be able to give it a number in its native language, and it will translate that number back into a format you can instantly understand. This is where the magic begins!

### Our Mission for Part I

We’ll conquer this foundation in four modules and an interlude, blending hands-on building with powerful theory and culminating in a show-stopping application:

-   **Module 0 (Optional Prelude): The Redstone Toolkit**
    Learn the absolute essentials of Redstone. We'll cover the core components and the rules of power that govern every circuit we'll ever build.

-   **Module 1: The 4-bit Input Interface**
    Build the computer’s "keyboard," a simple set of levers to input numbers in binary, the machine’s native language.

-   **Module 2: The Language of Logic**
    Take a crucial dive into the theory that powers all digital logic. This is the course’s most important lecture, where you’ll master the grammar of NOT, AND, OR, and XOR.

-   **Interlude (Optional): The Art of Compact Design**
    Bridge the gap between building for clarity and building for efficiency. A short but powerful lesson on Redstone engineering best practices.

-   **Module 3: Decoders and Digital Displays**
    Apply your new skills to a major challenge: creating a two-stage translator that converts binary into human-readable numbers on a stunning 7-segment display.

This part is crafted to deliver a thrilling payoff. You’ll start with basic switches and end with a device that feels alive. These concepts are the bedrock (pun intended) for everything to come.

### Why This Progression?

I’ve designed this course to build confidence step-by-step. It's frustrating to try and build something complex if you don't first understand the tools (Module 0) or the language (Module 1). The faster you see something working, the more driven you’ll be to push forward. Part I is all about giving you that tangible progress and a powerful sense of accomplishment as you complete your first fully-functional system.
