## Part I: The Foundations - Laying the Groundwork

Welcome to Part I of our journey to build a working computer from scratch! Every masterpiece starts with a strong foundation. In this part, we’re going to master the fundamental tools, concepts, and components that will allow us to communicate with our digital creation.

By the end of Part I, our computer won’t be thinking on its own yet, but we will have a complete input and output system. You’ll be able to give it a number in its native language, and it will translate that number back into a format you can instantly understand. This is where the magic begins!

### Our Mission for Part I

To build this foundation, we'll progress through five modules and two optional interludes. This structured path combines essential theory with practical labs, culminating in a single, fully-functional system:

-   **Module 0 (Optional Prelude): The Redstone Toolkit**
    Learn the absolute essentials of Redstone. We'll cover the core components and the rules of power that govern every circuit we'll ever build.

-   **Module 1: The 4-Bit Input Interface**
    Build a manual input interface, a simple set of levers to input numbers in binary, the machine’s native language.

-   **Module 2: The Grammar of Circuits – Foundational Logic Gates**
    Take the first crucial step into theory by building the three "verbs" of logic: NOT, OR, and AND.

-   **Module 3: The Art of Logic – Simplification and Special Gates**
    Level up from a builder to an architect. Learn to optimize circuits with the laws of logic and expand your gate toolkit with the powerful XOR, and the negated gates, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.

-   **Interlude I (Optional): The Art of Compact Design**
    Bridge the gap between building for clarity and building for efficiency with a short but powerful lesson on Redstone engineering best practices.

-   **Module 4: Decoders and Digital Displays**
    Apply your new skills to a major challenge: creating a two-stage translator that converts binary into human-readable numbers on a stunning 7-segment display.

-   **Interlude II (Optional): The Power of Abstraction in Practice**
    Learn how to package complex circuits into simple "black boxes" using the subcircuit feature in CircuitVerse, a key skill for managing large-scale designs.

This part is crafted to deliver a thrilling payoff. You’ll start with basic switches and end with a device that feels alive. These concepts are the bedrock (pun intended) for everything to come.

### Why This Progression?

I’ve designed this course to build confidence step-by-step. It's frustrating to try and build something complex if you don't first understand the tools (Module 0) or the language (Module 1). The faster you see something working, the more driven you’ll be to push forward. Part I is all about giving you that tangible progress and a powerful sense of accomplishment as you complete your first fully-functional system.

The first step on this journey is to master our tools. Let's begin in the Redstone Toolkit.
