# Part IV: Creating an Automated Computer

Incredible work on completing Part III. Our machine is now truly impressive. It has a powerful, versatile Arithmetic Logic Unit that can perform multiple types of calculations on command. We have built a genuine, manually-operated processor.

But a computer is more than a processor. It doesn't wait for a human to flip levers for every single step. A true computer can follow a list of instructions—a program—all on its own.

In Part IV, we give our machine a soul. The theme for this part is **Automation**. We are going to build the final architectural components that separate a static calculator from a dynamic, living computer. We will give it a memory to hold its thoughts and a heartbeat to drive it forward.

### Our Mission for Part IV

This part will see us construct the final pieces of the puzzle and assemble them into a single, cohesive, self-running system.

*   **In Module 10 (Memory),** we will tackle the concept of "state." We will build circuits called latches that can remember a value, giving our processor a "scratchpad" to store its results. This is the foundation of computer RAM.
*   **In Module 11 (The Grand Assembly - Automation),** we will build a clock to provide a steady pulse and a Program Counter to automatically step through a sequence of hard-coded instructions. We will take our hands off the levers and watch our creation execute a program for the first time.

By the end of this Part, you will have achieved the ultimate goal of this course: you will have orchestrated a collection of simple components into a machine that can run a program without your intervention.

Let's begin Module 10 and give our computer a memory.
